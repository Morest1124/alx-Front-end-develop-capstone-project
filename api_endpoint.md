Additional profile fields (read-only/computed):

- `completed_projects` - list of completed projects for the user (id, title, thumbnail, status).
- `portfolio` - list of thumbnail URLs derived from completed projects.
- `active_projects` - list of projects currently in progress.
- `projects_posted` - integer count of projects the user has posted.
- `avg_rating` - average rating computed from `Review` records (falls back to `profile.rating` if present).

Authentication notes:

- The API uses SimpleJWT for token-based authentication. Login returns `access` and `refresh` tokens. Use the `access` token in the Authorization header as: `Authorization: Bearer <access>`.
